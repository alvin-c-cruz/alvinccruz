<h1>What is Python?</h1>
<blockquote>
    <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.
    Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive
    for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing
    components together.
    Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance.
